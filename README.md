- 👋 Hello, I’m Kyle!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to write code
- 🌱 I’m currently training to learn programming in C#, querying data with Transact-SQL, programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3, GitHub fundamentals, and developing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Applications through MSSA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects that will help me better learn the fundamentals and get better :o)
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn!
